    <h3>1. Resources Used for the Provision of Services</h3>
    <p>
      User accounts have fixed limits in order that we can provide a well functioning
      service for all users. We can disable your account should there be any attempt
      to use the service in a way that we deem to be unreasonable and that affects
      the usage of the service by others. What consists of 'reasonable use' is
      completely at our discretion and your account may be disbled without prior
      notice if your usage is disruptive and if deemed necessary to restore a quality
      of service.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Protection of Privacy, User Data</h3>

      circumstances other than to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
      process, as required by law, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or
      defend against legal claims. We will never sell or share any of this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a secret has been recieved by a recipient, we have no way of retrieving
      said secret again, nor do we log or keep any data that tracks the sender or
      receiver's IP address. Necessary data that attaches the contents of a secret to
      a user account is kept only until the secret is received, at which point it is
      destroyed permanently.
